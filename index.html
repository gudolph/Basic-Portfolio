        <p>It's ten thousand miles between Kings landing and the wall. The Dothraki do things in their own time, for their own reasons. All men must die. King in the North. A forked purple lightning bolt, on black field speckled with four-pointed stars. Dunc the Lunk, thick as a castle wall. What is dead may never die. Dunc the Lunk, thick as a castle wall. A dream of Spring. The War of the 5 kings. The night is dark and full of terrors. Winter is coming. May the Father judge him justly. The bear and the maiden fair. Pay the iron price.</p>

        <p>The rains of castamere. Winter is coming. The War of the 5 kings. The Dothraki do things in their own time, for their own reasons. The War of the 5 kings. It's ten thousand miles between Kings landing and the wall. What is dead may never die. The War of the 5 kings. The Dothraki do things in their own time, for their own reasons. As High as Honor. A good act does not wash out the bad, nor a bad act the good. Each should have its own reward. Forgive my manners. I don't see many ladies these days. Lucky for the ladies. The tourney of Ashford Meadows. House Tarly of Horn Hill I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all the nights to come.</p>
